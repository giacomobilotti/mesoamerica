# Mesoamerica Urban data

This repository contains the scripts necessary to perform some quantitative analyses on urban data from Mesoamerica. 


## Repository structure

The repository contains scripts and input data organised in different folders as follows:

- master.qmd: the script needed to actually perform the analyses and plot the results. 

- scripts/: it contains additional scripts needed to prepare the data (e.g., converting formats, coordinates) and some basic visualisation.
